# asio-fsm
Finite State Machine programming pattern for C++/ASIO

## Motivation
While creating Asio programs, usually we're using the mental concept of a Finite State Machine (FSM). This tiny library aims to bring the mental concept closer to source code terms by eliminating boilerplate and make states reusable.

## Example
