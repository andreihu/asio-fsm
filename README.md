# asio-fsm
Finite State Machine programming pattern for C++/ASIO

## Project status
The project is in pre-alpha state. I am experimenting with the concept and try prove that it covers usecases properly.

## Motivation
While creating Asio programs, usually we're using the mental concept of a Finite State Machine (FSM).

## Documentation
See the wiki: https://github.com/andreihu/asio-fsm/wiki

## Requirements
Since the library is header only, nothing is needed to use it beyond a C++17 compliant compiler (checked with g++ and clang++) and Asio itself.

### Optional requirements
- CMake (to build examples)
- Boost (to build examples)
